# test_parser
Files in folder(alpha_parser):
- .md (task description)
- .py (script) 

Libraries used:
- Selenium 4.1.0

Parsed with using:
- XPath, 
- Class_name, 
- ID

The parsing result may differ from the expected - the pages select the products with the largest number of reviews and compare the prices of these products.

The parser can be improved by changing the logic of product selection, as well as by adding parsing of all pages with this product.
